# Historical Sales Data Analysis and Visualizations

## Overview

This repository contains a dataset for a Power BI-based data analysis project, developed for a freelance gig seeking insights from historical e-commerce sales data. The goal is to create interactive dashboards to support cross-departmental decision-making, focusing on two key areas: demographics and sales operations. The dashboards will analyze data from four tables (customer, orders, payments, and items) to provide actionable insights.

- **Demographics**: Suggested: Analyzing customer distribution by city, state, and unique customer IDs to understand purchasing patterns.
- **Sales Operations**: Suggested: Evaluating order trends, payment types, shipping performance, and product pricing to optimize operations.
